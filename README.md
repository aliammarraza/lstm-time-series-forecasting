### Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

I developed a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future values based on historical data. The project involved preprocessing a dataset from an Excel file, including normalizing data with Min-Max scaling. I implemented the LSTM model using PyTorch, training it to predict multiple features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error and compared with a baseline model inspired by the 'Thinking Fast and Slow' algorithm. This project highlights my proficiency in machine learning, data preprocessing, and deep learning techniques for time series forecasting.
